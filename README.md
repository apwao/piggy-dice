## Description
This is a game that allows two players to play against each other through rolling of a dice. A player rolls the dice and  accumulates points based on the value. The player has the option of rolling continously with the risk of rolling a one. Once the player rolls one, they lose all the points accumulated during that run. The player has the option of holding after a number of turns and passing to the other player. This helps then retain their points for a specific run. It is written in HTML, Javascript, Jquery, CSS and Bootstrap.
